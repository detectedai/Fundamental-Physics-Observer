# 🌊 Introduction

Here, we introduce **WA**veform **V**ector **E**xploitation (WAVE), a novel approach that uses Deep Learning to readout and reconstruct signals from particle physics detectors. This repository contains our open-source codebase and aims to foster collaboration and innovation in this exciting intersection of ML and physics.



## 🚀 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop and share Machine Learning techniques that can be applied to full-waveform time-of-flight detectors. These advanced methods are designed to enhance signal processing and interpretation, thereby pushing the boundaries of what's possible in particle physics research.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Implementation of WAVE using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Codebase designed for ease of use and adaptability.
- Support for running WAVE on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Sample images illustrating waveform analysis.

# 🔧 Requirements

Before you dive into waveform vector exploitation with our WAVE code, make sure your machine is set up with the following:

- Python 3.7 or later, plus these packages installed with `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `torch` (version 0.4.0 or later)
  - `tensorflow` (version 1.8.0 or later)
  - `plotly` (optional, for visualization)

# 🏃 Run Instructions

You can run the WAVE models using the following scripts:

- To use our PyTorch implementation, run `wave_pytorch.py`.
- For TensorFlow users, you can run `wave_tf.py`.
- If you're looking to deploy on Google Cloud Platform, explore `gcp/wave_pytorch_gcp.py`.
